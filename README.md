# rotating_vector

This project is intended to show how sine waves are generated by a rotating vector's shadow.

It consists of two parts:

* Arduino software
* PC software

## Arduino SW

The arduino SW controls a stepper motor.  The stepper motor is assumed to have a stick connected to it at right angles to the shaft.
This stick is the rotating vector.

The arduino SW supports several commands form the PC software. E.g.:

* rotate clockwise and counter clockwise at various speeds
* single half step in clockwise and counter clockwise direction
* rotate up to a certain angle and stop
* calibrate current position as the given angle

After arduino SW performs a half step, it sends the current angle in degrees and the current half step count to PC software via serial communication.

## PC SW

The main goal of the PC SW is to read the angle sent by arduino SW, and plot it on the screen.
The final goal is to show the user/audience how a sine wave is formed if the height of the
rotating vector is plotted against time.  For this purpose, calibration is required to sync the shadow
of the vector (assumed to be casted by the projector's light) with the sine wave being plotted
by this software.

The PC SW support various types of calibration and adjustments:

* Horizontal and vertical position of the X (or time) axis.
* Amplitude of the sine wave
* correction angles at 180 degrees to account for the bending of stick due to gravity
* thickness of the line being plotted
